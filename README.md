# Image caption generator 

A deep learning model that combines the use of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks for describing photo. The trained model accepts a test image and generates a sentence describing the image. 

Dataset: [Flicker 30K](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset) containing roughly 31k images with 5 caption per image.
